Already, we're going to start from the beginning together and focus on a clear structure and organization before we do any coding. I want to develop a 2D Web-based, Idle/Clicker in a fantasy city setting.
The player will only start with one character (later prestige system will allow more character slots).
The character will have various statPools such as Health, Stamina, Mana, EarthMana, FireMana, Rage, Focus, etc. that are used for various actions.
The character will have a wide variety of currencies that they can spend in various ways such as Gold, Arcana, Research, Scrolls, Codices, Tomes, Leather, Stone, Wood, Iron, Steel, Herbs, Gemstones, FireGemstones, etc. Some of these currencies will be earned through actions, others will generate over time due to other currencies, or both. For example Research can be generated through study but is also passively produced by having scrolls.
The character will also have skills. Skills will effect the available actions. Skills will level through various available actions.
The character will have a home that they has limited floorSpace. They will be able to purchase various furniture based on their class and skills and currencies.
The character will have a class that will effect available actions.
I am most familiar with an MVC style architecture but am somewhat familiar with component structure. I plan on using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript only for this game. Can you help me plan the architecture and identify areas I can develop systems further.

Edit
I'd be happy to help you plan the architecture for your fantasy city-based idle/clicker game. Let's start by organizing the core structure before diving into any code. I'll ask clarifying questions along the way to make sure we're aligned on the direction.

Game Architecture Overview
For a web-based idle/clicker game with the features you've described, I recommend a modular architecture that will allow for easy expansion. Let's consider the following high-level structure:

Core Game Engine: Manages game state, time, and event loops
Data Models: Character, skills, currencies, furniture, etc.
Action System: Available actions based on character class and skills
UI Components: Different views and interactive elements
Save/Load System: Browser local storage management
Questions before proceeding:
How complex do you want the UI to be? Simple and functional, or more elaborate with animations?
Do you have a specific game loop frequency in mind (ticks per second)?
Are there any specific design patterns you'd prefer to incorporate?
Will this be a single-page application, or do you want multiple "screens"?
How do you envision the progression system working?
Proposed MVC Structure
Since you're familiar with MVC, let's design around that pattern:

Models
GameState: Main state container
Character: Attributes, class, skills
StatPools: Health, Stamina, various Mana types, etc.
Currencies: All resources like Gold, Arcana, Research
Skills: Skill definitions and levels
Home: Layout, furniture placement, space management
Actions: Available actions and their effects
Views
GameView: Main game interface
CharacterView: Character details and stats
SkillsView: Skills display and progression
CurrenciesView: Resource display
HomeView: Home layout and furniture
ActionsView: Available actions menu
Controllers
GameController: Main game loop and state management
CharacterController: Character progression
CurrencyController: Resource generation and consumption
ActionController: Handling player actions
HomeController: Home customization
SkillController: Skill progression and effects
Key Systems to Develop Further
Based on your description, here are some systems that could benefit from further development:

Multi-resource Economy: How different currencies interact and generate each other
Skill Progression System: How skills level up and affect actions
Home Development: Furniture placement with space constraints
Class System: Different character classes with unique actions
Prestige System: You mentioned this for additional character slots
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these systems? Or would you prefer to focus on a specific component to start defining in more detail?




The UI will be text based. It should be a minimal design that utilized blacks/grays/white with occassional colors for things like the Health progress bar being red, stamina green, mana blue, etc. I don't need any icons or emojis all text based.
I don't have any specific but maybe 10/second?
Not 100% what you're asking here, please be more specific.
I would prefer a nav bar approach for the various screens. Main (where 80/90% of gameplay is), Skills, House, Status (Character screen for things like equipment and a later system), Inventory (later system), Adventure (later system). I would like a header for the game title that displays "characterName the Level characterLevel characterClass". The display I picture would be 4 sections between the header and footer. The left sidebar would be 13% and have all the current currencies displayed, the next section would be approx. 60% and be where all the interaction takes place for the various NAV screens, the next sidebar would be approx 13% and be where the current action and it's progress display, below that the statPools of Health, Stamina, Mana, etc display. The far right sidebar would again be approx 13% and have an adventure log of what each action did. "You helped a merchant setup their display: receive 1 gold." things like that.
The progression system has the character going from a lowly "Waif" (or similar starting class) into a trainee of some type (Warrior, Mage, Clerk, Scout, Thief) then slowly progressing along their chosen chain. The possibility of hybrid overlapping will be integrated in the future (or possibly from the beginning I don't have the whole system fleshed out). Eventually the character reaches vast power levels and establishes something like a Pantheon or Guild Hall that would allow the player to prestige into starting a new character but having some type of starting benefit.
Concerning Home Development. We are not worrying about layout. The only worry is floorSpace for the style of home and then the size of the homeUpgrade/furniture.
For example, a trainee mage has a home called "Master's Attic" FloorSpace: 10. The character can purchase a Magic Circle that takes up 2-3 floorSpace, a workbench - 2 floorSpace, bed 1 floorSpace. Things like that. Later a Wizard's Tower has 400 floorSpace and can have things like a NexusGate that takes up 100 floorSpace.

Edit
Thank you for providing those details! I now have a clearer picture of your game. Let's plan out the architecture based on your specifications.

UI Layout Structure
I understand you want a text-based, minimal design with a 4-section layout:

Header: Game title and character info
Left sidebar (13%): Currencies
Main section (60%): Interaction area
Right sidebar (26%): Current action/progress + StatPools + Adventure log
Let's organize this into a solid structure before writing any code.

Further System Details
Class Progression System
Start as "Waif" (base class)
Progress to trainee classes (Warrior, Mage, Clerk, Scout, Thief)
Further specialization in each class tree
Potential for hybrid classes later
End with powerful classes that enable prestige mechanics
Home System
Simple floorSpace management
Different home types with varying space (Master's Attic: 10, Wizard's Tower: 400)
Furniture with various space requirements and effects
Furniture locked behind class/level/currency requirements
Action System
Actions available based on class, skills, and furniture
Actions consume resources (StatPools, sometimes currencies)
Actions generate currencies and skill experience
Actions take time to complete (progress bar)
Completed actions generate log entries
Prestige System (Future)
Establish Pantheon/Guild Hall at high power levels
Reset character but with benefits for new character
Questions:
Should currencies have both a current value and a generation rate, or should generation only happen through active actions?
For stat pools like Health/Stamina/Mana, do you want these to regenerate over time or only through specific actions?
Would you like the action system to support queuing multiple actions, or only one active action at a time?
Do you have any specific ideas for how skills will affect actions (faster completion, better rewards, unlock new actions)?
Do you want to implement any form of automation or "idle" mechanics where certain actions can be set to repeat?



Both. For many the generation rate will start at 0 and upgrade over time.
To start they do not regenerate. Through later upgrades they'll have passive regen. The most common regen way will be actions. Ex. "Rest - gain 1 Health/Stamina/Mana per second.
I want the action system to start as 1 at a time but later upgrades may allow multiple. Example, a mage gets a "Mirror Self" upgrade that allows for 2 actions at a time. Also, if the system had both an active action and "rest" action. If the character is "Begging in the City Square" and runs out of stamina then it automatically switches to their "rest" action "Sleep in an Abandoned Shed" once the pools are full the character automatically returns to "Begging in the City Square". Does that make sense?
On skills they will mainly unlock new things depending on the skill and level. Example, learning "MageLore" unlocks the "Meditate on the Arcane" action. Learning "MageLore" would also unlock the Mana statPool and higher levels would increase maximum mana and mana regen rate. Unlocking a "Crafting" skill would allow a new action like "Scribe a Scroll" where the character no longer has to buy a scroll but can instead make their own. Or unlock a new Currency such as an Herbology skill unlocking Herbs.
I believe I answered this one with 5 but if you need clarity please ask. For example, "Begging in the City Square" produces between 0-2 gold and costs 2 stamina over 2 seconds. That action repeats until stamina reaches 0. Then the character's rest action takes over (starts with something like "Sleep in Abandoned Shed") once the various statPools are full the character returns to doing the previous action "Begging in the City Square" until the player switches actions. The default rest option will be upgradable.
As the player starts as a level 1 "Waif" (at least for now) they are homeless. The home mechanic will unlock as they grow.

Edit
Thanks for clarifying those details! Let's refine our architecture plan with these considerations in mind.

Updated Models
StatPool Model
No passive regeneration initially
Rest actions to regenerate stats
Future upgrades can enable passive regeneration
Maximum values influenced by skills
Action Model
Add support for "rest" actions that regenerate stat pools
Flag to mark actions as "rest" actions
Default rest action (Sleep in Abandoned Shed)
Automatic switching between active and rest actions
Future support for multiple simultaneous actions
Skill Model
Skills unlock new actions, currencies, and stat pools
Skills increase maximum stat pool values
Skills enable crafting/production actions
Skills can modify action effectiveness
Currency Model
Current value
Generation rate (starts at 0 for many)
Methods to modify generation rates through upgrades
Core Game Loop Logic
Let's refine the game loop to support your requirements:

Game ticks at 10/second
Each tick:
Update all stat pools
Check active action conditions
If active action lacks required resources:
Switch to default rest action
If rest action and stat pools are full:
Return to previous active action
Process active action progress
If action completes:
Apply rewards
Add to action log
Continue repeating action if possible
Class/Progression System
Start as "Waif" with limited actions and stats
Unlock home system when reaching a certain progression point
Class progression unlocks new actions, skills, and upgrades
Class-specific furniture and home options
Let's start by defining the core data structures for the main models. I'll use plain JavaScript objects to represent these structures without any implementation details yet.

Would you like me to prepare some basic model structures to start fleshing out this architecture? Or would you prefer to focus on a specific subsystem first, such as the StatPool management or Action system?




One last thing, I do want to track a few things with actions and make sure they are part of the save. I want to track the number of completions on an action as that could lead to improvements in that action. I also think the current progress on an action is something that should be part of a save. If someone closes the browser at 80% completion on "Swordfighting for Dummies" (this is just a silly example) then when they return to the game they should be at 80% completion on that rather than having to restart the action at the beginning.

Edit
Thank you for mentioning those important tracking requirements. Let's make sure to incorporate action completion counts and progress persistence into our design.

Updated Action Model
Let's update the Action model to include completion tracking and progress persistence:

javascript
// Action Model
{
  id: "string",              // Unique identifier
  name: "string",            // Display name
  description: "string",     // What the action does
  isRestAction: false,       // Is this a rest action?
  
  // Requirements
  requiredClass: "string",   // Required class (or null if any class can do it)
  requiredSkills: [],        // Array of required skills with minimum levels
  requiredFurniture: [],     // Array of required furniture
  
  // Costs and Duration
  statPoolCosts: {},         // Object mapping stat pool IDs to costs
  currencyCosts: {},         // Object mapping currency IDs to costs
  baseDuration: 2000,        // Duration in ms (at 10 ticks/second)
  
  // Rewards
  currencyRewards: {},       // Object mapping currency IDs to rewards
  skillExperience: {},       // Object mapping skill IDs to exp gained
  statPoolRestoration: {},   // Object mapping stat pool IDs to restoration
  
  // Tracking
  completionCount: 0,        // How many times this action has been completed
  totalTimeSpent: 0,         // Total time spent on this action (ms)
  
  // Progress Persistence
  currentProgress: 0,        // Current progress (0-1)
  lastActionStartTime: null  // When the current action instance started
}
Action Controller Updates
The ActionController needs to handle:

Saving progress when the game is closed
Restoring progress when the game is reopened
Tracking completion counts
Improvements based on completion counts
javascript
// Action Controller (pseudocode)
class ActionController {
  // ... other methods
  
  startAction(actionId) {
    // Set as current action
    this.currentAction = actionId;
    
    // If we have saved progress, restore it
    if (this.actions[actionId].currentProgress > 0) {
      // Resume from saved point
    } else {
      // Start fresh
      this.actions[actionId].currentProgress = 0;
      this.actions[actionId].lastActionStartTime = Date.now();
    }
  }
  
  processAction(deltaTime) {
    // If no current action, do nothing
    if (!this.currentAction) return;
    
    const action = this.actions[this.currentAction];
    
    // Check if we have enough resources
    if (!this.hasEnoughResources(action)) {
      // Switch to rest action
      this.switchToRestAction();
      return;
    }
    
    // Update progress
    action.currentProgress += deltaTime / action.baseDuration;
    
    // If action is complete
    if (action.currentProgress >= 1) {
      // Apply rewards
      this.applyActionRewards(action);
      
      // Track completion
      action.completionCount++;
      action.totalTimeSpent += action.baseDuration;
      
      // Add to log
      this.gameState.actionLog.add(action);
      
      // Reset progress for next iteration
      action.currentProgress = 0;
      action.lastActionStartTime = Date.now();
    }
  }
  
  switchToRestAction() {
    // Store the current action to return to later
    this.previousAction = this.currentAction;
    
    // Switch to default rest action
    this.currentAction = this.defaultRestAction;
  }
  
  checkRestActionCompletion() {
    // If current action is rest and stat pools are full
    if (this.isRestAction(this.currentAction) && this.areStatPoolsFull()) {
      // Return to previous action
      if (this.previousAction) {
        this.currentAction = this.previousAction;
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Check if completion count unlocks improvements
  checkActionImprovements(actionId) {
    const action = this.actions[actionId];
    
    // Check various thresholds
    if (action.completionCount >= 10) {
      // Maybe reduce duration by 5%
    }
    
    if (action.completionCount >= 50) {
      // Maybe increase rewards by 10%
    }
    
    // etc.
  }
}
Save/Load System
We'll need to make sure our save/load system captures:

All current values of stat pools, currencies, skills
Current action and its progress
Action completion counts
Unlocked content (actions, furniture, etc.)
javascript
// Save System (pseudocode)
class SaveSystem {
  saveGame() {
    const saveData = {
      character: this.gameState.character,
      statPools: this.gameState.statPools,
      currencies: this.gameState.currencies,
      skills: this.gameState.skills,
      home: this.gameState.home,
      
      // Action state
      currentAction: this.gameState.currentAction,
      previousAction: this.gameState.previousAction,
      actions: {}, // Only save tracking data, not full action definitions
      
      // Timestamp for offline progress
      timestamp: Date.now()
    };
    
    // Save action tracking data
    for (const actionId in this.gameState.actions) {
      saveData.actions[actionId] = {
        completionCount: this.gameState.actions[actionId].completionCount,
        currentProgress: this.gameState.actions[actionId].currentProgress,
        totalTimeSpent: this.gameState.actions[actionId].totalTimeSpent,
        lastActionStartTime: this.gameState.actions[actionId].lastActionStartTime
      };
    }
    
    localStorage.setItem('gameSave', JSON.stringify(saveData));
  }
  
  loadGame() {
    const saveData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('gameSave'));
    if (!saveData) return false;
    
    // Restore game state
    this.gameState.character = saveData.character;
    this.gameState.statPools = saveData.statPools;
    this.gameState.currencies = saveData.currencies;
    this.gameState.skills = saveData.skills;
    this.gameState.home = saveData.home;
    
    // Restore action state
    this.gameState.currentAction = saveData.currentAction;
    this.gameState.previousAction = saveData.previousAction;
    
    // Restore action tracking data
    for (const actionId in saveData.actions) {
      if (this.gameState.actions[actionId]) {
        this.gameState.actions[actionId].completionCount = saveData.actions[actionId].completionCount;
        this.gameState.actions[actionId].currentProgress = saveData.actions[actionId].currentProgress;
        this.gameState.actions[actionId].totalTimeSpent = saveData.actions[actionId].totalTimeSpent;
        this.gameState.actions[actionId].lastActionStartTime = saveData.actions[actionId].lastActionStartTime;
      }
    }
    
    // Handle offline progress
    this.processOfflineProgress(Date.now() - saveData.timestamp);
    
    return true;
  }
  
  processOfflineProgress(elapsedTime) {
    // Calculate resources generated while offline
    // Progress current action
    // etc.
  }
}
Suggested Initial Implementation Plan
Given the complexity, I suggest starting with a modular implementation approach:

Core Game Loop: Implement the basic tick system (10/second)
Stat Pool System: Implement basic stat pools with no regeneration
Basic Action System: Implement single action processing with progress tracking
Character System: Basic character model with class
Save/Load System: Ensure progress persistence works properly
UI Framework: Implement the 4-section layout
Action Log: Implement basic logging of completed actions
Then gradually add more complex systems:

Rest Actions: Implement automatic switching between active and rest actions
Skills System: Implement skill levels and their effects on actions
Currency System: Implement currencies with generation rates
Home & Furniture System: Implement when character progresses enough
Would you like me to start drafting code for any specific part of this system? Or would you like more detailed design for a particular component?
